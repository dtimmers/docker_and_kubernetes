# Docker and Kubernet: The Complete Guide

I'm following the Udemy course [Docker and Kubernet: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) and keep track of my progress here.
The end-goal of the course is to build a simple dockerized Flask web application that runs on AWS including an CI/CD pipeline running on Github and Travis CI.
